# Project Summary
For my project I would like to show information about the evolution of music through the ages. As a musician I have always looked towards music for inspiration and also
when I want to find empathy during a particular time. Personally I have seen how music has changed through the years, given that I am a 1990's person I have seen 
music go from salsa, rock, punk to reggaeton and techno; sometimes I look back and think to myself how did music went from what I knew to this new music and I can see 
people before me thinking the same thing. 
As it turns out the music liked by people is influenced by current events, I will be using information on the billboard top songs by year for the last week of the year 
and crossing that information with events that were taking place in that moment or close to that year (decade for example), I can say that I personally saw the rise
and fall of the "emo" phase; didnt really liked it but I guess it happened because a collective of people felt they didnt fit in with society. I would like to see
the same thing with this information but on a macro level and reducing it to the US so it can be more targeted and easier to identify trends if there are.

# Outline
The following outline displays which are the events that will be taken per decade and some examples of songs that people listened to heavily during that decade.

We can see some of the most important events in the sad zone given that I am trying to relate some of the events that happen back to the music being listened by people. 
What I hope to achieve is to display how people listening to certain music in a decade use it as a way to deal with the problems they are facing at that time, for 
example if I look back to the pandemic I remember listening to happy music in order to cope with the lockdowns; I want to find similar trends with the US data.
