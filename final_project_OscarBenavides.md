# Project Summary
For my project I would like to show information about the top 398 movies listed in IMDB. As a movie fan I am always trying to recommend good movies to the people I know.
There are a lot of good movies that people dont know because they might not be that "new" and also because of the inmense quantity of movies that come out every day
which makes it easy for one to lose track of which movies to watch.
Using this data my intent is to educate people of the distribution of movies in terms of genre, release year, director and stars. In that way we will be able to see how
many of the best movies came out in a given year and learn when the most fan treasured movies were released. Moreover, I consider many feaetures influence how good a
movie is rated by fans; for that reason I want to also display which is the genre that is most commonly found in the highest rated movies.
Also, as one may know the director and stars in the movie have a lot to do with the success of the picture; for this reason I would like to explore the number of movies
some actors take part in to display which are the movie stars that normally perform in the best movies.
Finally, to put it in perspective I would like to use the revenue collected by those movies and bring it to present money value so that one can imagine the ammount of 
money a movie collected in the moment of its release.
