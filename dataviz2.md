# Visualization of governments debt to GDP ratio per country from 1995 to 2021
The following graph has information on the debt to GDP ratio per country. Not all the countries have the same amount of data points and the last data
point for each country is being shown with a bigger point.

## How are these visualizations different?
Each visualization serves a different purpose even though they are all based on the same data. Our first visualization shows the debt to GDP ratio for one year only (2018) it does not really have any specific focus other than showing the ratios. The second visualization allows us to use a specific timeframe to see all the countries ratio by year marking the last datapoint. Finally, the third visualization focuses on showing which countries have a highes debt to GDP ratio.
We can say something that all visualizations have in common is that all show data for all countries. Also, the first and second visualization dont put a lot of emphasis on a trend or high points for the ratio and instead rely on just showing all the data not attracting the users attention to any particular data point (except that last point in the second visualization). 
The differences between the visualizations are easily spotted. The time frame for the first visualization is just one year, for the second visualization is from 1995 to 2021 and for the third visualization is for all years in the data. On the other hand, the second visualization only has one color for its sparkline whereas the third visualization uses a range of colors that go from gray to dark red. Moreover, the first visualization looks a little less cleaner than the other two given that it has its background colored and the other two visualizations only have a white background. Other than the fact that they are clearly different visualizations we can also say that what each is trying to show is different. The third visualization puts emphasis on identifying the countries with the highest debt to GDP ratios whereas the second one focuses on showing the last datapoint and the first visualization doesnt really focus on something specific. It just displays the information.
I chose the third visualization because the visualization explains itself, it directs the viewers attention to the colored data points and the title also does this. Also, the animation of displaying every year every few seconds adds dynamic to the presentation of the visualization. Just to give an example, it clearly shows us how Japan went from having a ratio of 94.74 in 1994 to 238.73 in 2017 (goes from a light gray to a very dark red). Moreover, the use of points that vary in size and color depending on the ratio makes it very intuitive reason why the viewer does not have to think a lot.
