# Benavides-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for telling stories with data

# About me
My name is Oscar David Benavides Millan. My pronouns are (He/Him) and I am currently on the MISM (Master of information systems management) program. I am interested in data and discovering insights in data to make decisions.

# What i hope to learn
What i want to learn in this course is how different types of visualizations can be used to clearly communicate an idea and tell stories with data given that sometimes even though we have the data it is hard to communicate all the information to the audience. Also, I want to learn techniques of the best practices to create visualizations. Once I graduate I want to work in a role that alows me to use the abilities I have acquired to analyze data, also I would like to find a role in which my insights are able to help stakeholders better understand a situation and make the best possible decisions.
