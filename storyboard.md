# Story board
As an initial sketch, I produced a story board in order to show it to different people and get their feedback:

## User research protocol
### Goals of showing story board
The goals I have by showing the story board to people are the following:
- Understanding of the graphs
- Evaluate if people are able to relate the graphs and trends to the social events
- Evaluating feeling of closeness people have to the theme
- Any unwanted friction from the way the story is told, is it clear enough?

### Interviews
- The target audience I hope to reach with my story are music lovers that wish to understand how music relates to social events in US
- In order to identify representative individuals to interview I needed to find people who spend a large time of their days listening to music. In order to classify them 
as such I asked them first how many hours a day they listened to music (approximately). If the answer was above 4 hours (US average) the people were classified as highly 
interested in music. Moreover, another question asked was how often they read the news and how interested they were in current events; if the response was that they 
constantly checked the news in order to inform themselves about current events then they were candidates for the interview.
