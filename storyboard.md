# Story board
As an initial sketch, I produced a story board in order to show it to different people and get their feedback:

## User research protocol
### Goals of showing story board
The goals I have by showing the story board to people are the following:
- Understanding of the graphs
- Evaluate if people are able to relate the graphs and trends to the social events
- Evaluating feeling of closeness people have to the theme
- Any unwanted friction from the way the story is told, is it clear enough?

### Interviews
- The target audience I hope to reach with my story are music lovers that wish to understand how music relates to social events in US
- In order to identify representative individuals to interview I needed to find people who spend a large time of their days listening to music. In order to classify 
them as such I asked them first how many hours a day they listened to music (approximately). If the answer was above 4 hours (US average) the people were classified as 
highly interested in music. Moreover, another question asked was how often they read the news and how interested they were in current events; if the response was that 
they constantly checked the news in order to inform themselves about current events then they were candidates for the interview.

#### Script
#### Introductory comments
Brief introduction: Share your name, "I am currently in CMU attending the Telling Stories with Data course and it is in my interest to expose you to some 
visual pieces and gather information from your feedback".

Discussion of the purpose of today’s test: “My goal today is to get feedback on a story being designed by me. I’m talking to people with  interests similar to 
yours to know if everything makes sense and you can in someway relate back to the story I am trying to tell. All feedback is anonymous, and the interview should take 
less than 10 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember this interview's purpose is to understand your personal connection to the story and how clear it seems to you. There are no wrong answers”
#### Main section

##### First part
Ask: How many hours on average you spend listening to music per day and how often do you check the news to inform yourself about current events
" I have my story board here. As you can see, the sections presented in this story board are divided in the most popular genres per decade and then a breakup per
decade in order to understand all the events that took place in an specific part of that decade. Furtheremore, there is one representative artist from that time
so that you as a music lover might identify him and understand the type of feelings that particular artist was trying to communicate to its audience. When looking
at the images and graphs please tell me what you like and what makes sense to you and when something is not clear enough or you find it to be too much or just not
interesting."
##### Second part
As the interviewed person goes through the story board: Ask what they think of some of the messages left in the story board, if the events depicted in the graphs are 
relevant and sound familiar. Also, ask follow up questions when they stop in a section for too long. Respond to questions about specific events for example
"Los Angeles riots" which may not be known to everybody so that the intended event is related to the music being presented.
##### Third part
- "Now that you have gone through the story board please tell me what kind of story do you think this piece is trying to tell?"
- "What did you get from the graphs?, are they clear and transmit you a message?"
- "Did you felt identified with the way society reacted to events through music? has that happened to you before?"
- "As a music lover, how interesting do you think this is? do you think people would be interested in understanding the effects of music on society and viceversa?"
- "Is any visual information not clear or causes friction?"
- "Who do you think would be interested in this site"
- "Do you have any comments or questions?"
