# Initial idea
For my project I would like to show information about the evolution of music through the ages. As a musician I have always looked towards music for inspiration and 
also when I want to find empathy during a particular time. Personally I have seen how music has changed through the years, given that I am a 1990's person I have seen 
music go from salsa, rock, punk to reggaeton and techno; sometimes I look back and think to myself how did music went from what I knew to this new music and I can see 
people before me thinking the same thing. <br>
As it turns out the music liked by people is influenced by current events, I will be using information on the billboard top songs by year for the last week of the year 
and crossing that information with events that were taking place in that moment or close to that year (decade for example), I can say that I personally saw the rise
and fall of the "emo" phase; didnt really liked it but I guess it happened because a collective of people felt they didnt fit in with society. I would like to see
the same thing with this information but on a macro level and reducing it to the US so it can be more targeted and easier to identify trends if there are.
# The data
For this project, I obtained the information needed by constructing it from two datasets. Both datasets were downloaded from the site: 
https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017  shared by @kcmillersean. The datasets contain information on the billboard top 100 up until 2020 which 
includes information such as the week in which a particular song was in the ranking, which position, for how long, etc. Moreover, the is also information on the songs 
like the duration, genres, spotify popularity, etc.
In addition to the link to the datasets, I have created a file which has all the information I plan to use for my project which you can find here by the name 
(Music_Evolution.xlsx):

# The audience
The target audience I hope to reach with my story are music lovers that wish to understand how music relates to social events in US and how it helps some people cope
with what is happening at that moment. These people would be in the age range of 15 - 75 which would be an age range in which people have an awareness of what is
happening around them and need to find ways to deal with said events or outside pressures. This story is only made for people living in the US given that it emphasizes
on events that are profoundly related with the US and does not touch upon events in other countries; moreover, the information of preference per genre was obtained
from the billboard 100 of each year which contains only information on US preference.
# Summary
I had to split my project into three parts to adequately develop it and obtain all the necessary feedback and tools to create a compelling story.
- For part 1 of my project I sketched some of the visualizations I would use to tell my story. These visualizations were a close approximation to what my end product 
would be and allowed me to visualize which ideas I wanted to present. Furthermore, I also did some data exploration to understand what I would need to produce the 
needed graphs. 
- For part 2 I picked a tool to tell my story (shorthand) and filled it with all the information from my story. I had to do some data processing in order to make
it easy for flourish to graph the information how I wanted; when I was going through my picked solution I had to give up on using Tableau given that the visualizations
I was producing were not having the same visual effect I was getting on flourish. As soon as i was done putting all the information together and uploading all the 
visualizations into shorthand I wanted to have feedback from people who would be interested in this type of information and also that were part of my target audience.
In order to identify representative individuals to interview I needed to find people who spend a large time of their days listening to music. In order to classify 
them as such I asked them first how many hours a day they listened to music (approximately). If the answer was above 4 hours (US average) the people were classified as 
highly interested in music. Moreover, another question asked was how often they read the news and how interested they were in current events; if the response was that 
they constantly checked the news in order to inform themselves about current events then they were candidates for the interview. In addition to this,
these people would be in the age range of 15 - 75 which would be an age range in which people have an awareness of what is happening around them and need to find ways 
to deal with said events or outside pressures. Also I needed to find people living in the US given that it emphasizes on events that are profoundly related with the US 
and does not touch upon events in other countries.
Based on the interviews I performed to get feedback from my story I got some interesting ideas to connect back to the story I was showing my audience. The feedback I 
got was the following:
- A section which details the general feeling of the decade would be great for each of the decades displayed
- Information about the danceability of songs for example would be interested to further dig into the theme, might that be interesting?
- Graphs are clear and connect key events to some popular genres in an specific time <br> <br> <br>
After going through the feedback, I made some changes to my story such as creating a banner for each of the years which shows which was the general sentiment of the
decade according to the events that were happening around that time. Also, I created a visualization based on the attributes of the songs such as how much energy
does the song have, how much happiness it transmits and how danceable a given song is; then with information from this song I obtained an average of the score
and reflected that per decade so we could see how each decade changed in these three attributes, this definitely helped to have a more global overview of the music 
preference in a given decade and relate it back to the music nowadays. <br> <br>
## Second modification on audience?
After going through the changes made taking my first target into account I realized that not only people who are heavily into music should be though of as the target
audience but also people who are not; moreover even though all the information was done taking into account US history and US data, actually people from other
countries can as easily relate to the final message. With this in mind, my final audience are people between 15-75 years given that at this age they already have
a good awareness of what is happening around them and are probably dealing with multiple complex emotions. <br>
After speaking with 2 people 25 years old and 28 years old respectively and asking for their opinion on the story I had a common feedback around the story telling. The 
message was on the background but there wasnt a clear statement of how the points were connected with the music characteristics. <br>
The story was showing how was the music trend over the decades, which were the most significant events during that particular decade and also characteristics of the 
songs in that decade but what was the conclusion or the 'call to action'?. With that in mind, I created a last piece of information including the message I was trying
to convey but way more specific; citing studies in which experts have discussed the effects of music on peoples mood
