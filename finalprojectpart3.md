# Project Summary
For my project I would like to show information about the evolution of music through the ages. As a musician I have always looked towards music for inspiration and also
when I want to find empathy during a particular time. Personally I have seen how music has changed through the years, given that I am a 1990's person I have seen 
music go from salsa, rock, punk to reggaeton and techno; sometimes I look back and think to myself how did music went from what I knew to this new music and I can see 
people before me thinking the same thing. 
As it turns out the music liked by people is influenced by current events, I will be using information on the billboard top songs by year for the last week of the year 
and crossing that information with events that were taking place in that moment or close to that year (decade for example), I can say that I personally saw the rise
and fall of the "emo" phase; didnt really liked it but I guess it happened because a collective of people felt they didnt fit in with society. I would like to see
the same thing with this information but on a macro level and reducing it to the US so it can be more targeted and easier to identify trends if there are.
# The data
For this project, I obtained the information needed by constructing it from two datasets. Both datasets were downloaded from the site: 
https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017  shared by @kcmillersean. The datasets contain information on the billboard top 100 up until 2020 which 
includes information such as the week in which a particular song was in the ranking, which position, for how long, etc. Moreover, the is also information on the songs 
like the duration, genres, spotify popularity, etc.
In addition to the link to the datasets, I have created a file which has all the information I plan to use for my project which you can find here by the name 
(Music_Evolution.xlsx):

# The audience
The target audience I hope to reach with my story are music lovers that wish to understand how music relates to social events in US and how it helps some people cope
with what is happening at that moment. These people would be in the age range of 15 - 75 which would be an age range in which people have an awareness of what is
happening around them and need to find ways to deal with said events or outside pressures.
# Summary
I had to split my project into three parts to adequately develop it and obtain all the necessary feedback and tools to create a compelling story.
- For part 1 of my project I sketched some of the visualizations I would use to tell my story. These visualizations were a close approximation to what my end product 
would be and allowed me to visualize which ideas I wanted to present. Furthermore, I also did some data exploration to understand what I would need to produce the 
needed graphs. 
- For part 2 I picked a tool to tell my story (shorthand) and filled it with all the information from my story. I had to do some data processing in order to make
it easy for flourish to graph the information how I wanted; when I was going through my picked solution I had to give up on using Tableau given that the visualizations
I was producing were not having the same visual effect I was getting on flourish. As soon as i was done putting all the information together and uploading all the 
visualizations into shorthand I wanted to have feedback from people who would be interested in this type of information and also that were part of my target audience.
In order to identify representative individuals to interview I needed to find people who spend a large time of their days listening to music. In order to classify 
them as such I asked them first how many hours a day they listened to music (approximately). If the answer was above 4 hours (US average) the people were classified as 
highly interested in music. Moreover, another question asked was how often they read the news and how interested they were in current events; if the response was that 
they constantly checked the news in order to inform themselves about current events then they were candidates for the interview.
Based on the feedback I got from showing my
