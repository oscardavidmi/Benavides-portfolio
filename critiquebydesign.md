# Critique by design
The following is a critique of a visualization I was interested in. The URL to the visualization is: https://studentwork.prattsi.org/infovis/visualization/changes-in-the-gaming-industry/ the name of the visualization I picked from this report is "Genre releases over time". Please check the reference page for the complete reference.
## Why did I pick this visualization?
There were a couple of reasons why I picked this visualization. The first one and strongest one was that I am passionate about gaming, I love to play games and so I am
very interested on it since I am a long time fan. Moreover, when I was looking through the information I was surprised to see the trend of genre releases through the
years and also the declining number of game releases through the years. The last reason why I picked the visualization was because I felt something else could be done to
make the chart more understandable and help to transmit a story to people who like me are interested in gaming.
## The road to a new visualization
### Using Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile
I started of by using Stephen Few's guide to evaluate a visualization. I went through all of the characteristics that are tested in a visualization such as the usefulness, completeness, etc. After evaluating the visualization I reflected on what worked on the visualization and what didnt to understand which made me understand
that I didnt really like the scale that was used for the visualization; it was confusing since it was a sequential palette and categories could not be told apart.
Moreover, the title did not provide any real insight so it was not clear to me what exactly we wanted to see in this graph, the name of the axis seemed a little to
simple for my taste as well and there was information that was missing; how could i know the number of releases per year if information had been omitted.
On the other hand, I really liked the graph since a stacked bar was the way to go to display various categories through the years. 
After thinking of the information I wanted to convey with this visualization and understanding what worked and what did not, I produced an idea of what a good 
visualization that would convey a message would look for me.
### Sketching a solution
After understanding the visualization, realizing which story I wanted it to tell and to whom I had an idea of how to make an effective visualization. But first I wanted
to create a quick sketch and test it out with a couple of people so that I could know if it was conveying the message I wanted.
I used the online tool Figma and created
