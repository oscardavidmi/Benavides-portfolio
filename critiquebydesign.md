# Critique by design
The following is a critique of a visualization I was interested in. The URL to the visualization is: https://studentwork.prattsi.org/infovis/visualization/changes-in-the-gaming-industry/ the name of the visualization I picked from this report is "Genre releases over time". Please check the reference page for the complete reference.
## Why did I pick this visualization?
There were a couple of reasons why I picked this visualization. The first one and strongest one was that I am passionate about gaming, I love to play games and so I am
very interested on it since I am a long time fan. Moreover, when I was looking through the information I was surprised to see the trend of genre releases through the
years and also the declining number of game releases through the years. The last reason why I picked the visualization was because I felt something else could be done 
to make the chart more understandable and help to transmit a story to people who like me are interested in gaming.
## The road to a new visualization
### Using Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile
I started of by using Stephen Few's guide to evaluate a visualization. I went through all of the characteristics that are tested in a visualization such as the usefulness, completeness, etc. After evaluating the visualization I reflected on what worked on the visualization and what didnt to understand which made me understand
that I didnt really like the scale that was used for the visualization; it was confusing since it was a sequential palette and categories could not be told apart.
Moreover, the title did not provide any real insight so it was not clear to me what exactly we wanted to see in this graph, the name of the axis seemed a little to
simple for my taste as well and there was information that was missing; how could i know the number of releases per year if information had been omitted.
On the other hand, I really liked the graph since a stacked bar was the way to go to display various categories through the years. 
After thinking of the information I wanted to convey with this visualization and understanding what worked and what did not, I produced an idea of what a good 
visualization that would convey a message would look for me.
### Sketching a solution
After understanding the visualization, realizing which story I wanted it to tell and to whom I had an idea of how to make an effective visualization. But first I 
wanted to create a quick sketch and test it out with a couple of people so that I could know if it was conveying the message I wanted.
I used the online tool Figma and created the following sketch to show how I thought the visualization should be displayed:

### Testing out my solution
After sketching my solution I wanted to get feedback from other people to know if I was accomplishing my objective. For this reason I decided to conduct a little 
survey on two people to know their opinions on the visualization which would be used as base for my final visualization. The questions I asked can be seen below:

1.	Can you tell me what you think this is?
2.	Can you describe to me what it is telling you?
3.	What do you think is the objective of the visualization?
4.	Is there something that impacts you?
5.	Who do you think would appreciate having this information?
6.	Is there anything you would change from this visualization?

And the feedback I got from the two interviews I performed was the following:

Adult mid 30’s - active gamer
1.	A game release chart according to the genre
2.	Dominating genre in the market in gaming according to the year
3.	To make a market analysis on game release according to the genre
4.	Sudden decrease in action release in 2012, taking into account that genre had been the most stable. 2008 marked a high point in game releases and then it plummeted
5.	Game producers
6.	Nope, it’s pretty clear

Adult mid 30’s - not a gamer
1.	It is a stacked graph displaying video game genre throughout the years
2.	Action genre games are mostly the most demanded ones.
3.	Highlight the popularity of action games in the industry
4.	In 2012 the action games aren’t the favorite ones anymore
5.	Some one that enjoys playing video games, and want to know which genre to buy. Also a company that wants to create a new video game.
6.	Emphasis is done in the highest genre so its clear, not too many groups should be used

The feedback gave me some information I wanted to take into acount for my final visualization. The analysis I generated from my interviews was:

•	What patterns in the feedback emerge? 
  o	 The intent of the visualization was done, knowledge of the trend of genres was displayed and also one of the people interviewed observed the change in trend when 
     the number of releases suffered a big reduction after 2008.
  o	 One of the people interviewed manifested that using a low number of groups its ok but that increasing the groups too much would call too much attention on each of 
     the categories
•	What did you learn from the feedback?
  o 	I learned that the graph is telling a story and giving information both on trends of genre as well as adding information on the quantity of releases per year
  o 	I learned that I should reduce the number of categories being displayed so as to not overwhelm the viewer with too much information
•	What will I change in my graph?
  o	 I was thinking of following the example of the first visualization and using 10 categories to show the biggest 10 genres per year but after the feedback I will  
     only be using 5 categories per year and an extra category called “other” which will have the sum of the rest of genres.
  o	 I would also like to add a filter that users can use to see some years in more detail, given the trend of the industry some years have very few releases and that
     doesn’t make it very easy to appreciate a difference between the genres

### The final visualization
After going through the process of:
1. Finding a visualization I was interested in
2. Evaluating it to understand what I liked and what I didnt like
3. Proposing modifications for the visualization
4. Sketching a possible solution
5. Conducting some interviews and drawing ideas to make my visualization better

I came up with a final visualization which can be seen below:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1668314703357' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Action genre almost always dominates in gaming ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ga&#47;GamingGenres&#47;Hoja1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='GamingGenres&#47;Hoja1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ga&#47;GamingGenres&#47;Hoja1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='es-ES' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>
var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1668314703357');
var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

#### What story does the visualization tell
- From the visualization we can appreciate how each year there are 5 genres that dominate the industry because of the number of releases
- We can appreciate how the game releases had a steady increase from 1996-2000 , 2001-2008 and then the number of game releases decined from 2009-2016
- We can also see how the action genre has been the genre that gets the most releases but for 2016 when the adventure genre had a slightly higher number of releases

#### Why I selected this visualization and what did i attempt to do differently
The reason why I kept the stacked bar which was the same graph the original visualization had was because I really liked the way it showed the different game releases 
categories while also providing an overview of the trend for game releases through the years; the use of stacked bars is adequate given the information that wants to
be given to the people reviewing the visualization.
Somethings I attempted to change were the focus to telling a story and the colors that were being used. I wanted to show the trend of the gaming industry in what had 
to do with number of releases per year and I also wanted to evidence which is the genre that almost always dominates in terms of number of releases to understand the 
industry trend.
